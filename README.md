# Booleando Shop

**Description**: <br>
This is a simple online shop section, wich displays six of its products. <br>

**Focus**: <br>
The main concept in creating this page is learning how to use the ```position:relative``` and ```position:absolute``` property in css, and the ```:hover``` selector as a bonus.
The ```position``` property is used to place html elements inside each of the products containers, while the ```:hover``` selector is used to change the image of each product
when the user's pointer is over it.
